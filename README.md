# Secret Texts
###### by iTzPhil


Secret Texts is a Node.js script by @iTzPhil (me) to encode and decode text messages. The tool is developed to be easy to use for everyone.  Also I want to make this tool available in multiple languages. If you are able to translate into a language which isn't supported feel free to create a pull request.
