# Sectret Texts
###### by iTzPhil

Secret Texts is a Node.js script by @iTzPhil (me) to encode and decode text messages. The tool is developed to be easy to use for everyone.  Also I want to make this tool availabel in multiple languages. If you are able to translate into a language wich isn't supported feel free to create a pull request.
